                        <p>I'm a CS student based in metro-Atlanta, practicing and learning code whenever I can. 
                            My interests in computer science lie in human-computer interactions, cybersecurity,
                            and generative art. My works are constantly in progress.

                <p>
                    Currently, I am a second year student at <b>Georgia Tech</b> for my Bachelor's of Science and 
                    intend on pursuing Media and People as my threads. I'm interested in UI/UX and front-end development but am open
                    to exploring other fields, as well!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The technologies I have dabbled with so far are:
                </p>

                <br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>LC-3 Assembly</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Besides computer science, I am also very interested in healthcare and medical research. Outside of school, 
                    I enjoy baking, watching horror movies, and playing/watching people play video games. I also heavily 
                    involve myself in the arts by playing the cello and sketching/drawing in my spare time.
